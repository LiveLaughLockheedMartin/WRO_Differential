## Future Engineer attempt by SP Team Differential

We are Students from Robotics Innovation & Technology club from Singapore Polythenics. Our team consist of three members: Zeliks , Lucas and Benedict. We create our team on 4<sup>th</sup> June  2024 after our club's Annual General Meeting. In that meeting, we found out about this competitions. Let's get into the contents of our robot.

### Steering 

For steering, we use principles of Ackerman Steering Mechanism. The steering is connected by Tie Rod which make two wheels turn at different angles. So, it make possible for two wheels rotates at different speed which make turning smoother.  

### Motor at Rear

We use TB6612FNG motor driver to run the motor. It is very efficient for low power supply and it generate low heat due it built in thermal shutdown. The motor rotate the differential gear which turn the two wheels at the same speed.
